# Drishti: Computer Vision-Based Assistive Navigation System

## Introduction

Drishti is an innovative computer vision-based assistive navigation system designed to empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings independently and safely. This repository contains all the code and resources necessary to understand and implement Drishti. Our solution leverages Intel's AI Analytics tool and advanced computer vision algorithms to provide real-time, accurate information about the user's environment, helping them make informed decisions and avoid obstacles.

## Problem Statement

Visually impaired individuals face challenges in safely and independently navigating their surroundings due to limited perception of objects and obstacles. Existing solutions like canes and guide dogs have limitations in providing real-time and accurate information about the environment, which hinders their mobility and poses safety risks.

## Solution Description

Drishti addresses these challenges by using a mobile device's camera and our web app to capture live video input and analyze the visual data in real-time. Here's how it works:

1. **Object Detection:** Drishti identifies objects in the user's environment using advanced computer vision algorithms.

2. **Depth Estimation:** The system employs depth estimation techniques to measure the distance between the user and detected objects with precision.

3. **Audio Feedback:** Based on the analysis, Drishti provides immediate audio feedback and warnings to the user about the detected objects and their distances.

By enhancing spatial awareness and providing reliable guidance, Drishti promotes safer and more independent navigation for visually impaired individuals.

## Key Features

- Real-time object detection using computer vision algorithms.
- Accurate depth estimation for precise distance measurements.
- Immediate audio feedback and warnings to assist users in avoiding obstacles.
- User-friendly web app interface.
- Compatibility with mobile devices equipped with cameras.

## Usage

1. Open the Drishti web app on your mobile device.
2. Allow access to the camera.
3. Point the camera towards your surroundings.
4. Drishti will identify objects and provide audio feedback about their distances.
5. Use the feedback to navigate safely and independently.
